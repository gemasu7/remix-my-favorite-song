<p> 
Oh baby here comes the sound <br>
I took a train outta New Orleans and they shot me full of ephedrine <br>
This is how we like to do it in the murder scene <br>
Can we settle up the score? <br> 
<br>
If you were here, <br>
I'd never have a fear <br>
So go on live your life <br>
But I miss you more than I did yesterday <br>
(You're beautiful) <br>
<br>
Well I'm a total wreck and almost every day <br>
Like the firing squad or the mess you made <br>
Well don't I look pretty walking down the street <br>
In the best damn dress I own? <br>
<br>
If you were here, <br>
I'd never have a fear <br>
So go on live your life <br>
But I miss you more than I did yesterday <br>
You're so far away <br>
So c'mon show me how <br>
'Cause I mean this more than words can ever say <br>
<br>
We are, made from the sharpest things you'd say <br>
We are young and we don't care <br>
Your dreams and your hopeless hair <br>
We never wanted it to be this way <br>
For all our lives <br>
Do you care at all? <br>
<br>
If you were here, <br>
I'd never have a fear <br>
So go on live your life <br>
But I miss you more than I did yesterday <br>
You're so far away <br> 
So c'mon show me how <br>
'Cause I mean this more than words can ever say <br>
